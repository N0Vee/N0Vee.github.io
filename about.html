            <p>In 1883, tailor August Stenströms realized his dream and opened a shop in the heart of Helsingborg. His
                knowledge of how to sew shirts he had learned from his many trips to Berlin and now he took this
                expertise with him to convince the Swedes about fabric, fit and feel in the perfect shirt. The rumor
                spread quickly that the Tailor in Helsingborg made them the best shirts and in 1899 Stenström's shirt
                factory was started and success was soon a fact. At the same time, the store was sold to merchant Knut
                Håkansson, who continued to run the store with Stenström's shirts as the most important product group.

                The store, Stenströms Herr & Damekipering, is located today at Stortorget 12, Helsingborg, Sweden and
                has done so since 1906. Today, the store is run by the Anderberg family, who are the fifth family to
                carry on the legacy of August Stenströms.</p>
